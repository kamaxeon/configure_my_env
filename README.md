# Set up my environment
The main idea of this repository is to configure my work environment.

## Getting Started

You must download the repository and run the ansible playbook

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamaxeon/config_my_laptop
cd config_my_laptop
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -b
```

### Prequisites 


Obviously, you need to have ansible and git installed on your machine, if you do not have it, you can do it quickly with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y git ansible
```

Your user must be in the sudoers group as admin

It is designed to work with Ubuntu, and has been tested with version 18.04

## Tags

The playbook has a list of labels, which allows us to launch only the part that interests us

For your use, you can specify them when launching the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -b -t my_tag1,mytag2
```

You can also exclude:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -b --skip-tags=my_tag1,mytag2
```

Below you can see all the labels
